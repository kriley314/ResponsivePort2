                    <p id=intro>My name is Ken Riley and I'd like to welcome you to my page.  I grew up here in Austin and attended The University of Texas from 1980-1984.  I graduated in 1984 with a BS in Computer Engineering.</p>
                    <p id=moreAboutMe>I worked doing software development for most of the next 30 years before taking a bit of time for myself to do some traveling and pursuing a few hobbies.</p>
                    <p id=yetMoreAboutMe>When I made the decision to pursue getting back into software development I found that my skill set had fallen behind to the point where I felt that my best option to be able to competitively contribute was to return to school and here I am!!</p>
